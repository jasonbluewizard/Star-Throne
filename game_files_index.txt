Star Throne Single Mouse Button Control System - Current Files Export
================================================================

The following files contain the current implementation of the single mouse button control system:

Core Input System:
- InputHandler.js - Mouse event handling, camera drag separation from clicks
- InputStateMachine.js - FSM for territory selection and fleet commands
- updateActiveFleets.js - Lightweight per-frame hop advancement for multi-hop fleets

Main Game Engine:
- StarThrone.js - Main game controller with integrated fleet movement system
- PathfindingService.js - Path finding for multi-hop fleet movements

Support Systems:
- SupplySystem.js - Supply route management
- gameConstants.ts - Centralized game configuration constants

Current Control Scheme:
- Left-click: Select territory, then click targets to send 50% fleet
- Shift + left-click: Send all available fleet (minus 1 for defense)  
- Ctrl + left-click: Send 25% of fleet for conservative attacks
- Right-click + drag: Camera movement (separated from game commands)

Recent Fixes Applied:
- Fixed 300ms click delay that made controls feel unresponsive
- Separated camera dragging from click detection to prevent cursor sticking
- Implemented immediate click processing for responsive controls
- Added comprehensive debug logging to track click detection and fleet commands

Issues Still Present:
- Basic left-click territory selection and fleet movement may still need debugging
- Multi-hop fleet pathfinding integration needs verification
- Fleet command execution through combatSystem needs testing
