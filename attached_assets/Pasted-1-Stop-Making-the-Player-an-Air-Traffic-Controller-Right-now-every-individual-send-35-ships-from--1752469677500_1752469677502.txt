1 — Stop Making the Player an Air‑Traffic Controller
Right now every individual “send 35 ships from Alpha to Beta” click is a mini chore. The quickest way to turn that into broad‑stroke strategy is to persist the order so the planet keeps obeying until the player says otherwise.

Mechanic	What the Player Does	Under‑the‑Hood Behaviour	Why It Fixes Micromanagement
Flow Line (Galcon‑style)	Drag from A to B once; line stays.	Each tick, planet A exports X % of its garrison along that line.	One gesture sets up a permanent reinforcement path; player only tweaks percentages.
Overflow Valve	Click planet, set “cap = 40 ships”.	Any ships above cap auto‑flow to the nearest friendly planet that’s under‑cap.	Keeps the network balanced without visits to each planet.
Rally Beacons	Click empty space; beacon appears. Drag planets onto it.	Those planets auto‑send all new ships to the beacon’s location.	Lets the player reposition the front line with one move.

Implementation is mostly UI + one queue per planet. No AI rewrite needed—AI can keep using explicit commands.

2 — Replace Warp Lanes with a Range Radius
Removing hardcoded warplanes/lanes and giving each player a ship range stat simplifies pathfinding and produces clear front lines.

Base Range – e.g. 2.5 × planet spacing units.

Contiguous‑Range Rule – A fleet may hop only to a planet (neutral or owned) that is within its owner’s current range from any friendly planet.

Upgrades – Research increases radius by 15 % per tier.

Soft Supply Cut‑Off – If a planet is isolated (no friendly neighbour inside range) its production drops by 50 %.

Benefits

Factor	Range System	Old Lane System
Path Visual Clarity	One clean circle overlay per planet; fades with zoom.	Spaghetti lines everywhere.
Player Mental Load	Only ask: “is it in range?”	Must memorise lane graph.
UI Gestures	Click‑drag anywhere inside the range circle.	Must find lane endpoints.

Edge cases (e.g., “island” planets) are solved with a ‘Relay Portal’ tech—deploys a temporary portal that counts as a friendly range anchor for 60 s.

3 — Macro Control Sketch (Minimal Code, Big UX Gain)
plaintext
Copy
LMB drag      = Create / move Flow Line
Hold SPACE    = Show range circles for all owned planets
TAB           = Cycle rally beacons (centres camera)
Mouse‑wheel   = Scale % of garrison exported on hovered line
RMB on planet = Toggle Overflow Valve cap (20 / 40 / ∞)
Two gestures + one modifier key cover 90 % of routing.

4 — Fail‑Fast Prototype Sequence
Sprint (1–2 days each)	Scope	Kill Switch
A. Range Radius Only	Hard‑remove lanes; fleets can move anywhere in range via straight line.	If testers hate it in <30 min, revert branch.
