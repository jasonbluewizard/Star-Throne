Of course. A fluid and intuitive user interface is the heart of any great strategy game. It's the bridge between the player's strategic mind and the action on screen. For a mouse-centric platform like a Chromebook, every click and drag needs to feel responsive and meaningful.
Based on best practices in UI/UX design, here are my suggestions for improving the mouse controls and visual feedback in your game, focusing on clarity, intuition, and player engagement.
Core Principles: Intuitive Controls and Clear Feedback
The goal is to reduce the player's cognitive load, allowing them to focus on strategy, not on fighting the interface.[1] Every action should be easy to perform and provide immediate, understandable feedback.[2, 3]
 * Context-Sensitive Controls: A powerful way to make controls intuitive is to make the mouse context-aware. The most common and effective pattern in RTS games is using the right-click as the primary action button.[4]
   * Right-click on an enemy: Issues an attack order.
   * Right-click on a friendly planet: Issues a transfer order.
   * Right-click on empty space: (If units were mobile) Issues a move order.
     This consolidates multiple actions into a single, easy-to-remember input, which is ideal for fast-paced gameplay.
 * Multi-Level Visual Feedback: Player actions should trigger a cascade of feedback, from subtle cues to bold confirmations. This ensures the player always knows their command was received and what its outcome was.[5]
   * Level 1: Affordance (What can I do?): The UI should hint at possible actions before the player even clicks.
   * Level 2: Confirmation (What am I doing?): The UI should provide clear feedback during an action, like dragging.
   * Level 3: Resolution (What happened?): The UI should show the result of the action after it's complete.
Improving Specific Actions
Let's apply these principles to the core actions in your game.
1. Selecting Planets
 * Hover Effect (Affordance): When the mouse hovers over a planet, it should subtly glow or have its outline brightened. This signals "this is an interactive object" without requiring a click.[6, 7] A simple tooltip should also appear, showing the planet's name and army count.
 * Selection Indication (Confirmation): When a planet is selected (left-click), it needs a strong, unambiguous visual indicator.
   * A thick, pulsating outline in the player's color is a classic and effective choice.
   * For multiple selections, using a standard click-and-drag box selection is essential for any RTS.[8, 9] All planets within the box should receive the selection outline.
2. Attacking an Enemy Planet
 * Control Scheme:
   * Left-click your planet to select it.
   * Right-click an enemy planet to issue the attack order.
 * Visual Feedback:
   * Affordance: When a friendly planet is selected and the player hovers the mouse over a valid enemy target, the cursor should change from a pointer to an "attack" icon (e.g., crosshairs or a sword). The target planet could also get a faint red outline.
   * Confirmation: The existing drag-and-drop line is a great start. To enhance it:
     * Make the line a bold, aggressive red.
     * Animate the line with a subtle "pulse" moving from the attacker to the target to indicate direction.
     * When the mouse is released over the target, the target planet should flash red briefly to confirm the command was received.[3]
   * Resolution:
     * The ship animations should be visually distinct for attacks. They could be a different color or shape than transfer ships.
     * When the attack resolves, clear visual effects like small explosions or energy flashes on the defending planet provide satisfying feedback on the outcome.[3]
3. Transferring Fleets to a Friendly Planet
 * Control Scheme:
   * Left-click your planet to select it.
   * Right-click another friendly planet to issue the transfer order.
 * Visual Feedback:
   * Affordance: When hovering over a friendly planet with a unit selected, the cursor should change to a "move" or "reinforce" icon (e.g., a set of arrows).
   * Confirmation: The drag-and-drop line should be a friendly, non-threatening color like cyan or green. This instantly differentiates it from an attack order.
   * Resolution: The ship animation should look like a transport or cargo vessel. Upon arrival, a gentle "power-up" or shield-like pulse effect on the destination planet can signify reinforcement, distinct from the explosive feedback of an attack.
4. Visualizing Supply Routes
Supply routes are a persistent state, so their visualization needs to be clear but not distracting.[10]
 * Control Scheme: Since this is a more deliberate, strategic action, it should have a dedicated input.
   * Suggestion: Select a planet, then use a hotkey (e.g., 'S' for Supply) or click a "Create Supply Route" button in the planet's UI panel. Then, click the destination planet. This prevents accidental creation.
 * Visual Feedback:
   * Persistent Lines: Supply routes should be rendered as persistent lines on the map. Using a dashed or dotted line helps distinguish them from solid attack/transfer lines.[10]
   * Directional Animation: The dashes on the line should slowly animate in the direction of the supply flow. This provides an at-a-glance understanding of which way resources are moving, which is critical for strategic planning.[11]
   * Clear On/Off State: When a supply route is active and transferring units, the animated line could be brighter or a more saturated color. When it's idle (e.g., the source planet doesn't have enough units to send), it could dim slightly. This provides passive information about the state of your logistics network.
   * Interactive Management: Clicking on a planet should display icons in its UI panel indicating active incoming and outgoing supply routes. Clicking these icons could select the route, highlight its full path on the map, and provide an option to delete it. This makes managing a complex network of routes much more intuitive.[12]
By implementing these suggestions, you create a user experience that is not only easier to learn but also more satisfying to master. Clear feedback empowers players to make faster, more confident strategic decisions, which is the essence of a compelling RTS game.[2]
