That's an excellent and crucial question. The decision of how many ships to send versus how many to leave behind is the strategic heart of your game. The user interface must make this core trade-off feel both intuitive and impactful. A clumsy interface will frustrate players, while a well-designed one will empower them to make split-second strategic decisions.
Here are several best-practice approaches to handle this, ranging from simple and fast to detailed and tactical. The best solution is often a combination of these, giving players options that match their playstyle and the situation at hand.
Guiding Principle: Clarity vs. Speed
The fundamental design challenge is balancing the speed of issuing a command with the clarity of the information presented. Every action a player takes should be meaningful, and the UI's job is to provide clear, immediate feedback so the player can make confident decisions without getting bogged down in menus or unnecessary clicks.
Solution 1: The "Commit Half" Default (Fast & Simple)
This is the most common and streamlined approach in many RTS games. It prioritizes speed, making it ideal for fast-paced actions.
 * How It Works: A standard right-click on a target planet (or a click-drag-release action) automatically sends 50% of the source planet's available fleet. The game always leaves a garrison behind.
 * Visual Feedback:
   * Affordance: When a friendly planet is selected, hovering over a valid target could change the cursor to an "attack" or "move" icon.
   * Confirmation: The drag-and-drop line appears as you drag. Upon release, a number briefly animates out from the departing fleet (e.g., "-50") to confirm the quantity sent. The number on the source planet immediately updates.
   * Resolution: The ship animation proceeds as normal.
 * Pros:
   * Extremely Fast: It's a single, decisive action.
   * Low Cognitive Load: The player doesn't have to think about numbers; they can trust the default to be a reasonable choice.
   * Safe: Prevents players from accidentally leaving a critical planet completely undefended.
 * Cons:
   * Lacks Precision: Not ideal for situations where a player wants to send a specific number of ships (e.g., a small probing force or an overwhelming final assault).
Solution 2: The Proportional Drag (Granular & Visual)
This method provides much more control and makes the trade-off visually explicit.
 * How It Works: The player left-clicks and holds on their planet. As they drag the cursor away from the planet's center, the percentage of the fleet to be sent increases. Releasing the mouse button over a valid target commits the action.
 * Visual Feedback:
   * Affordance & Confirmation: As soon as the drag begins, a radial UI element appears around the source planet. This could be a pie chart or a two-color ring that fills up as you drag further out.
   * Explicit Numbers: Inside or next to this radial UI, two numbers are clearly displayed and update in real-time: "Sending: 75" and "Remaining: 25". This provides immediate, unambiguous feedback on the consequence of the action.
   * The drag-line to the target is still present, colored appropriately for an attack or transfer.
 * Pros:
   * High Precision: Gives the player exact control over the fleet split.
   * Excellent Feedback: The visual representation of the split makes the strategic choice tangible and easy to understand.
 * Cons:
   * Slower: Requires more precise mouse movement than a simple click.
   * Can add some visual clutter during intense moments.
Solution 3: The Modifier Key System (Power User Control)
This approach layers on top of the "Commit Half" default, providing shortcuts for expert players who value speed and efficiency. This is a staple of competitive RTS games.
 * How It Works:
   * Right-Click: Sends 50% of the fleet (the default).
   * Shift + Right-Click: Sends 100% of the available fleet (leaving the minimum 1 ship). This is the "all-in" command.
   * Ctrl + Right-Click: Sends a smaller, fixed amount, like 25% or a specific number (e.g., 10 ships), perfect for reinforcements or probes.
 * Visual Feedback:
   * Affordance: The mouse cursor could change slightly when a modifier key is held down. For example, holding Shift could add an exclamation point to the attack cursor (Attack!!).
 * Pros:
   * Extremely Fast for Experts: Allows for rapid, precise commands without any extra UI elements.
   * High Skill Ceiling: Rewards players who learn the hotkeys with greater efficiency.
 * Cons:
   * Less Discoverable: New players might not know about the modifiers without a tutorial or tooltip.
Recommendation: A Hybrid Approach
For the best player experience, you don't have to choose just one. I recommend implementing a layered system that caters to all skill levels:
 * Make the "Commit Half" (Solution 1) the default action for a simple right-click or drag-and-drop. This is your baseline, ensuring the game is immediately accessible and intuitive.
 * Add the "Modifier Key System" (Solution 3) for power users. This provides the depth and speed that experienced strategy players expect.
 * Consider adding the "Proportional Drag" (Solution 2) as an alternative input. For instance, a left-click-and-hold drag could activate the proportional UI, while a right-click drag performs the default 50% transfer.
This hybrid model creates a system that is easy to learn but offers a high skill ceiling. A new player can play the entire game effectively with simple clicks, while a veteran can optimize their actions with hotkeys and precise controls, making the gameplay experience satisfying for everyone.
