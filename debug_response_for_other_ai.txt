RESPONSE TO OTHER AI'S DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS
==========================================

Based on current browser console analysis:

1. "InputHandler initialized successfully" message:
   STATUS: NEED TO VERIFY - Added try/catch in StarThrone.js but need to check console

2. JavaScript errors during game load:
   OBSERVED: "unhandledrejection" error appears in console logs
   TIMING: Appears after game starts, before any user input
   IMPACT: Likely blocking event handler initialization

3. Canvas validation before InputHandler:
   ADDED: Canvas validation logging in init() method
   CHECKS: 
   - this.canvas exists
   - addEventListener method available  
   - Canvas element type
   - Canvas in DOM tree

4. setupCanvas() modifications:
   CONFIRMED: setupCanvas() creates canvas element and injects into DOM
   CODE:
   ```javascript
   setupCanvas() {
       const canvasElement = document.createElement('canvas');
       canvasElement.id = 'gameCanvas';
       canvasElement.width = window.innerWidth;
       canvasElement.height = window.innerHeight;
       
       const root = document.getElementById('root');
       if (root) {
           root.innerHTML = '';
           root.appendChild(canvasElement);
       }
       
       this.canvas = canvasElement;
       this.ctx = canvasElement.getContext('2d');
   }
   ```

CURRENT CONSOLE OUTPUT ANALYSIS:
- "Fleet: Rendering 0 animations" - Fleet system works
- "StarThrone: Calling fleet.render()" - Render loop active
- NO InputHandler messages visible yet
- NO canvas validation messages yet
- "unhandledrejection" error present

NEXT VERIFICATION STEPS:
Need to refresh and check console for:
1. Canvas validation output
2. InputHandler initialization success/failure
3. Specific JavaScript error causing unhandled rejection

The canvas setup appears standard but the unhandled rejection suggests an async error during initialization that's preventing event handlers from attaching properly.
